AJAX Requests
=======
To perform an Ajax request you have to have two packages installed ajax-promise and axios

LifeCycle Method
=======
Function called on a component class that is automatically called by React.
ComponentDidMount will run as soon as the component is loaded in the DOM.

Routing Switch
=======
Switch will look at all of the routes inside it, it will only map the first to the specific URL.
Always use this to resolve issues with components appearing with each other.

React Router Links
=======
We don't want another HTTP request via an <a href="">
We use {Link} from 'react-router-dom'
<Link className="btn btn-primary" to="/posts/new"> Add a post</Link>

Redux Form Library
=======
The component is a function that renders the JSX the field only deals with
ReduxForm. <Field name="title" component={this.renderTitleField}/>
its better to create a helper function that will sit above render method.
{...field.input} Is an object that contains various event handlers onBlur onChange etc.
